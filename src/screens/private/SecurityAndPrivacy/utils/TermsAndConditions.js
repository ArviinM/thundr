      Welcome to Thundr’s Terms and Conditions of Use (these “Terms”). This is a
      contract between you and Tanders,Inc. (“We” or “us”) and we want you to
      know yours and our rights before you use the Thundr website or application
      (“Thundr” or the “App”). Please take a few moments to read these Terms
      before enjoying the App, because once you access, view or use the App, you
      are going to be legally bound by these Terms (so probably best to read
      them first!).{'\n\n'}
      Please be aware that if you subscribe to services for a term (the “Initial
      Term”), then the terms of your subscription will be automatically renewed
      for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Term at
      Thundr’s then-current fee for such services, unless you cancel your
      subscription.{'\n'}
      THUNDR RULES{'\n'}
      Before you can use the App, you will need to register for an account
      (“Account”). In order to create an Account you must:{'\n'}• be at least 35
      years old; and{'\n'}• be legally permitted to use the App by the laws of
      your home country.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      You can create an Account via manual registration, or by using your
      Facebook login details, Google account login details or Apple account
      login details. If you create an Account using your Facebook login, or
      Google login or Apple login you authorize us to access, display and use
      certain information, (e.g. name, profile pictures, etc). For more
      information about what information we use and how we use it, please check
      out our Privacy Policy. By using our App, you acknowledge that we may
      collect and use of your data and information in accordance with our
      Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, we cannot allow you to use another person’s
      Account or to share your Account with any other person without permission.
      You’ll have great fun on Thundr, but if you feel the need to leave, you
      can delete your Account at any time by going to the ‘Settings’ page when
      you are logged in and clicking on the ‘Delete account’ link. Your Account
      will be deleted immediately but it may take a little while for Your
      Content (defined below) to be completely removed from the App. Your
      profile information will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
      If you delete your Account and try to create a new account within this
      time period using the same credentials, we will re-activate your Account
      for you. We use a combination of automated systems and a team of
      moderators to monitor and review accounts and messages for content that
      indicates breaches of these Terms. We reserve the right at our sole
      discretion to terminate or suspend any Account, restrict access to the
      App, or make use of any operational, technological, legal or other means
      available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking
      specific IP addresses), at any time without liability and without the need
      to give you prior notice. Without limiting the foregoing in any way, we
      expressly reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Account without
      notice (1) for violating these terms, (2) due to your conduct on the App,
      or your conduct with other users of the App (including your “offline”
      conduct), if we, in our sole discretion, determine your conduct was
      inappropriate or improper, (3) if we or our affiliates, in our or their
      sole discretion, determine your conduct on other apps operated by our
      affiliates was inappropriate or improper, or (4) for any reasons
      whatsoever that we deem, in our sole discretion, justifies termination. If
      your Account is terminated or suspended, you agree you will not receive a
      refund for any paid service or features you have already been charged for.
      You may not access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the App or our
      systems. Certain portions of the App may not be accessible if you have not
      registered for an Account.{'\n'}

      {'\n'}
      Your Content{'\n'}
      You agree that Your Content must comply with our Guidelines as updated
      from time to time. As Your Content is unique, you are responsible and
      liable for Your Content and will indemnify, defend, release, and hold us

      {'\n'}
      You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your
      individual profile page whether in relation to you or any other person
      (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email
      addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details). If you do
      choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users,
      whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you
      to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third
      parties online as you would under any other circumstances.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}

      viewed by other users and any person visiting, participating in or who is

      whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed
      in the future).{'\n'}

      We may assign and/or sub-license the above license to our affiliates and
      successors without any further approval by you.{'\n'}

      purposes, to spam, to harass, stalk or to make unlawful threats. We

      No Obligation to Pre-Screen Content.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      Since Thundr is an online community, we generally try to avoid getting in
      the way and therefore don’t assume any obligation to pre-screen any of

      {'\n'}

      responsible for your interactions with other users of the App.{'\n'}

      CHECKS ON ITS USERS. THUNDR ALSO DOES NOT INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUNDS OF
      ITS USERS OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF ITS USERS. THUNDR MAKES
      NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OF ANY USERS OR THEIR
      COMPATIBILITY WITH ANY CURRENT OR FUTURE USERS. THUNDR RESERVES THE RIGHT
      TO CONDUCT ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX

      Scraping or replicating any part of the App without our prior consent is
      expressly prohibited. This includes by any means (automated or otherwise)
      other than through our currently available, published interfaces - unless
      you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with
      us.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      PRIVACY{'\n'}
      For information about how the Thundr collects, uses, and shares your
      personal data, please check out our Privacy Policy. By using Thundr, you
      acknowledge that we may use such data in accordance with our Privacy
      Policy .{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      PAYMENT TERMS{'\n'}
      Generally.{'\n'}
      Thundr may offer products and services for purchase on the App (“In-App
      Purchase”). If you choose to make an In-App Purchase, you acknowledge and
      agree that additional terms, disclosed to you at the point of purchase,
      may apply, and that such additional terms are incorporated herein by
      reference.{'\n'}
      You may make an In-App Purchase through the following payment methods
      (“Payment Method”): (a) making a purchase through a third-party platform
      such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store (“Third Party Store”),
      or (b) paying with your credit card, debit card, or PayPal account, which
      will be processed by a third-party processor. Once you have made an In-App
      Purchase, you authorize us to charge your chosen Payment Method. If
      payment is not received by us from your chosen Payment Method, you agree
      to promptly pay all amounts due upon demand by us.{'\n'}
      Subscriptions and Auto-Renewal: Thundr may offer some services as
      automatically-renewing subscriptions, e.g., one-month subscription or
      one-year subscription (“Premium Services”). IF YOU PURCHASE AN
      AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL RENEW AT THE
      END OF THE PERIOD, UNLESS YOU CANCEL, AT THUNDR’S THEN-CURRENT PRICE FOR
      SUCH SUBSCRIPTIONS. To avoid charges for a new subscription period, you
      must cancel, as described below, before the end of the then-current
      subscription period. Deleting your account or deleting the application
      from your device does not cancel your subscription. You will be given
      notice of changes in the pricing of the Premium Services to which you have
      subscribed and an opportunity to cancel. If Thundr changes these prices
      and you do not cancel your subscription, you agree that you will be
      charged at Thundr’s then-current pricing for subscription.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      Because our Services may be utilized without a subscription, canceling
      your subscription does not remove your profile from our Services{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      Free Trials. If you sign up for a free trial and do not cancel, your trial
      may convert into a paid subscription and your Payment Method will be
      charged at the then-current price for such subscription. Once your free
      trial converts to a paid subscription, your paid subscription will
      continue to automatically renew at the end of each period, and your
      Payment Method will be charged, until you cancel. To avoid charges for a
      new subscription period, you must cancel before the end of the
      then-current subscription period or free trial period as described above.
      Deleting your account or deleting the application from your device does
      not cancel your free trial. If you have signed up for a free trial on
      Thundr through the Apple Store or Google Play Store previously, you will
      not be eligible for another free trial and you will then be automatically
      signed up to a subscription and charged as described in this paragraph.
      {'\n'}
      Refunds. Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there
      are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.{'\n'}
      YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, WITHOUT PENALTY OR OBLIGATION, AT ANY
      TIME PRIOR TO MIDNIGHT OF THE THIRD BUSINESS DAY FOLLOWING THE DATE YOU
      SUBSCRIBED (EXCLUDING SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS). IN THE EVENT THAT YOU DIE
      BEFORE THE END OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR ESTATE SHALL BE ENTITLED
      TO A REFUND OF THAT PORTION OF ANY PAYMENT YOU HAD MADE FOR YOUR
      SUBSCRIPTION WHICH IS ALLOCABLE TO THE PERIOD AFTER YOUR DEATH. IN THE
      EVENT THAT YOU BECOME DISABLED (SUCH THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO USE THUNDR)
      BEFORE THE END OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOU SHALL BE ENTITLED TO A
      REFUND OF THAT PORTION OF ANY PAYMENT YOU HAD MADE FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION
      WHICH IS ALLOCABLE TO THE PERIOD AFTER YOUR DISABILITY BY PROVIDING THE
      COMPANY NOTICE IN THE SAME MANNER AS YOU REQUEST A REFUND AS DESCRIBED
      BELOW.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      PUSH NOTIFICATIONS; LOCATION-BASED FEATURES{'\n'}
      We may provide you with emails, text messages, push notifications, alerts
      and other messages related to the App and/or the Thundr services, such as
      enhancements, offers, products, events, and other promotions. After
      downloading the App, you will be asked to accept or deny push
      notifications/alerts. If you deny, you will not receive any push
      notifications/alerts (only in paid subscriptions, but for free subscribers
      may receive push advertisements, promos, etc.). If you accept, push
      notifications/alerts will be automatically sent to you. If you no longer
      wish to receive push notifications/alerts from the App, you may opt out by
      changing your notification settings on your mobile device. {'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      The App may allow access to or make available opportunities for you to
      view certain content and receive other products, services and/or other
      materials based on your location. To make these opportunities available to
      you, the App will determine your location using one or more reference
      points, such as GPS, Bluetooth and/or software within your mobile device.
      If you have set your mobile device to disable GPS, Bluetooth or other
      location determining software or do not authorize the App to access your
      location data, you will not be able to access such location-specific
      content, products, services and materials. For more about how the App uses
      and retains your information, please read the Privacy Policy.{'\n'}

      OF THE BARGAIN AND REFLECTS A FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK. THE APP AND SITE
      WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT THE

      THIRD PARTY APP STORE{'\n'}
      The following additional terms and conditions apply to you if you download
      the App from a Third Party Store. To the extent that the other terms and
      conditions of these Terms are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict
      with, the terms and conditions of this Section, the more restrictive or
      conflicting terms and conditions in this Section will apply, but solely
      with respect to the App and the Third Party Store. {'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      You acknowledge and agree that:{'\n'}
      1. These Terms are concluded solely between you and Tanders, Inc. and not
      with the providers of the Third Party Store, and Tanders, Inc. (and not
      the Third Party Store providers) is solely responsible for the App and the
      content thereof. To the extent that these Terms provide for usage rules
      for the App which are less restrictive or in conflict with the applicable
      terms of service of the Third Party Store from which you obtain the App,
      the more restrictive or conflicting term of the Third Party Store will
      take precedence and will apply.{'\n'}
      2. The Third Party Store provider has no obligation whatsoever to provide
      any maintenance and support services with respect to the App. Tanders,
      Inc. is solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or
      implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed. The Third Party
      Store provider will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to
      the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or
      expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be
      the sole responsibility of Tanders, Inc..{'\n'}
      3. Tanders, Inc., not the Third Party Store provider, is responsible for
      addressing any claims you or any third party may have relating to the App
      or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to:
      (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform
      to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising
      under consumer protection or similar legislation; and/or (iv) intellectual
      property infringement claims.{'\n'}
      4. The Third Party Store provider and its subsidiaries are third party
      beneficiaries of these Terms, and, upon your acceptance of these Terms,
      the Third Party Store provider from whom you obtained the App will have
      the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these
      Terms against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      In the event of a conflict between a Third Party Store’s or mobile
      carrier’s applicable terms and conditions and these Terms, the terms and
      conditions of the Third Party Store or mobile carrier shall govern and
      control. We are not responsible and have no liability whatsoever for
      third-party goods or services you obtain through a Third Party Store or
      mobile carrier. We encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel
      necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online transaction
      with any of these third parties.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      TERMINATION AND REMEDIES{'\n'}
      These Terms commence on the date you accept them (as described in the
      preamble) and continue until terminated in accordance with the terms
      herein.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      You can delete your Account at any time by logging into the App, going to
      the “Settings” tab and following the instructions to terminate your
      account. Please note that if you delete your Account, your subscription
      will continue until the end of the subscription period for which
      applicable fees have been paid, and you will not be entitled to a refund.
      {'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      In the event that Tanders, Inc. determines, in its sole discretion, that
      you have breached any portion of these Terms, have misused the App, or
      have otherwise demonstrated conduct which Tanders, Inc. regards as
      inappropriate or unlawful (whether on or off the App), Tanders, Inc.
      reserves the right to: (a) warn you via email (to any email addresses you
      have provided to Thundr) that you have violated the Terms; (b) delete your
      User Content; (c) discontinue your Account; (d) discontinue your
      subscription(s) without refund; (e) notify and/or send your User Content
      to and/or fully cooperate with the proper law enforcement authorities for
      further action; and/or (f) pursue to any other action which Tanders, Inc.
      deems to be appropriate. You agree that all terminations for cause shall
      be made in Tanders, Inc’s sole discretion and that Thundr shall not be
      liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account.
      {'\n'}
      Termination of these Terms or your Account includes the removal of access
      to your Account, and all related information and content associated with
      or inside your Account.{'\n'}
      If your account is terminated by you or by Tanders, Inc. for any reason,
      all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive, shall
      survive termination of these Terms, including, without limitation, the
      Arbitration Agreement, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers and
      limitation of liability. Your information will be maintained and deleted
      in accordance with our Privacy Policy.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      MISCELLANEOUS{'\n'}
      There are a few more things we need to mention before you can use Thundr.
      {'\n'}
      These Terms, which we may amend from time to time, constitute the entire
      agreement between you and Tanders, Inc.. The Terms supersede all previous
      agreements, representations and arrangements between us (written or oral),
      excluding the Privacy Policy. Nothing in this clause shall limit or
      exclude any liability for fraudulent misrepresentation.{'\n'}
      Thundr has taken reasonable steps to ensure the currency, availability,
      correctness and completeness of the information contained on Thundr and
      provides that information on an "as is", "as available" basis. Tanders,
      Inc. does not give or make any warranty or representation of any kind

      of Thundr and the materials available on it is at your sole risk. Tanders,
      Inc. is not responsible for any loss arising from the transmission, use of
      data, or inaccurate Member Content.{'\n'}
      You are responsible for taking all necessary precautions to ensure that
      any material you may obtain from Thundr is free of viruses or other
      harmful components. You accept that Thundr will not be provided
      uninterrupted or error free, that defects may not be corrected or that
      Thundr, or the server that makes it available, are free of viruses or
      bugs, spyware, Trojan horse or any similar malicious software. Tanders,
      Inc. is not responsible for any damage to your hardware, software, or
      other equipment or technology including, but without limitation damage
      from any security breach or from any virus, bugs, tampering, fraud, error,
      omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission,
      computer line or network failure or any other technical or other
      malfunction.{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      The communications between you and Thundr may take place via electronic
      means. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications
      from Thundr in electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and
      conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications
      that Thundr provides to you electronically satisfy if it were to be in
      writing. {'\n'}
      We know our Terms are awesome, but we may have to change them now and
      again{'\n'}
      As Tanders, Inc. grows, we might have to make changes to these Terms so we
      reserve the right to modify, amend or change the Terms at any time (a
      “Change”). If we do this then the Changes will be posted on this page and
      we will indicate the Effective Date of the updates at the bottom of the
      Terms. In certain circumstances, we may send an email to you notifying you
      of a Change. It’s also possible that we might ask you to agree to our
      Changes, but we’ll let you know. You should regularly check this page for
      notice of any Changes – we want our users to be as informed as possible.
      {'\n'}
      Your continued use of Thundr following any Change constitutes your
      acceptance of the Change and you will be legally bound by the new updated
      Terms. If you do not accept any Changes to the Terms, you should stop
      using Thundr immediately (uh oh, that’s going to be hard!).{'\n'}
      {'\n'}
      Additional items:{'\n'}
      If, for any reason, any of the Terms are declared illegal, invalid or
      otherwise unenforceable by a court of a competent jurisdiction, then to
      the extent that term is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be
      severed and deleted from the Terms and the remainder of the Terms shall
      survive, remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and
      enforceable.{'\n'}
      No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under the
      Terms shall operate as a waiver of such right or acceptance of any
      variation of the Terms and nor shall any single or partial exercise by
      either party of any right, power or privilege preclude any further
      exercise of the right or the exercise of any other right, power or
      privilege.{'\n'}
      The App may contain links to third-party websites or resources. In such
      cases, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable
